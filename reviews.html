					<h1>The Jazzy Jukebox</h1>
					<h2>The Woodlands, Texas</h2>
					<img class="rating" src="images/three.png" alt="three" title="three" height="40">
					<p>A group of us gave this place a try based on the recommendation of another friend. We had a group of eight, which got us placed in one of the smaller rooms, which was fine. The three couches would have adequately accommodated all of us even none of us had been up singing. One of the mics in the room didn't really work very well though, and the room got warm fairly quickly, though I found it tolerable. The staff moved us to the room next door, which I thought was nice.</p>
					<p>The second room was a little larger, and it had some light effects, which was cool. Everything was great, but we noticed that the sound kept getting increasingly louder. By the end, the volume from the system and the mics had become painfully loud, and the staff insisted that there was nothing they could do. One even tried to say that the songs were pre-programmed that way, which I think was just an excuse. We obviously attempted to adjust the volume, but the controls made absolutely no difference. It all sounded the same at the lowest settings all the way to the highest setting.</p>
					<p>I asked if they could try resetting the system, but I was told that was not possible. I went back inside, though, and I found a switch next to the system and flipped it off. As it was rebooting, one of the staff came in and asked if we'd powered it off and then walked out angrily when I said that I had. It didn't help the sound, but it clearly didn't hurt anything either.</p>
					<p>Since they were not offering to put us in a different room, we decided to cut our evening short at two and a half hours because we couldn't handle being in that room any longer. You'd think they would have offered us a discount because of the problems, but no. The price of the room should have been $30 per hour for 3 hours unless we bought enough food and drinks to cover the cost, at which point it would just be $30 plus the price of food. Everyone in the group averaged about a $20-30 tab, and yet my friend was charged $90 for the room. He was pretty sick of the place by that point, though, so he paid, and we all left.</p>

					<h1>The Snazzy Songshop<h1>
					<h2>Las Vegas, Nevada</h2>
					<img class="rating" src="images/five.png" alt="five" title="five" height="40">
					<p>I love this place!! This was probably the cheapest karaoke night my crew has ever experienced. However, we were only there for two hours instead of our usual four, and we only got two bottles of flavored soju, but for $15 a bottle, it was good. We got lychee, and it was delicious. It's your basic Korean karaoke establishment with private rooms. The song books are the same as others I've been to with your standard giant karaoke remote control wrapped in plastic with English translation, so you actually know what you're pressing. The room was clean, it had comfy couches, and it came with a tambourine!</p>
					<p>We called ahead, and we were told they would call within the next two hours when a room for five was available on a Saturday night. They called about one hour later. We taxied there from the Cosmopolitan, and we were escorted to our room right away. We got there around midnight.</p>
					<p>The service was good. The waiter arrived within a couple minutes after we pressed the button. I used the Yelp deal for a free shaved ice with ice cream which came with berries and Frosted Flakes. It was pretty good, especially since it was free. Later in the night they gave us a free plate of French fries! It was perfect timing after the drinking. We were very pleased with this place. My friends and I definitely plan to come here for all Vegas trips from now on. If you love karaoke, and you're in Vegas, this is the place for you!</p>

					<h1>The Lullaby Lounge</h1>
					<h2>New Orleans, Louisiana</h2>
					<img class="rating" src="images/four.png" alt="four" title="four" height="40">
					<p>I went with a group of friends for karaoke. We reserved a small private room. They have a system where if you spend enough money on food and drinks, you don't have to pay hourly for the room. The price schedule is posted on the door, but we smashed the limits with our excessive drinking.</p>
					<p>The food and drinks are completely secondary to the karaoke experience. I wasn't blown away by my menu choices, but nobody in the group complained about them either.</p>
					<p>The room has a U-shaped sectional sofa, a coffee table, a flat screen on the wall, and rack of karaoke electronic equipment. There are two mics and both are wired with long cords. The cords had been kinked so many times that they only intermittently worked. Two separate equipment swaps brought them into a working condition that we deemed acceptable, but it still wasn't 100%.</p>
					<p>Eight people fit snugly in the small room but our group gradually ballooned to 15, which was a tight and sweaty fit, even on a cold night. We were warned against having over 10, that we might be kicked out, but the waitress didn't care and helped keep our violation secret by quickly closing the door. It was much appreciated! </p>
					<p>I'm used to the gorgeous karaoke facilities in Dallas that we have thanks to the huge number of Korean immigrants and frankly this place doesn't compare well to that standard. They should invest in some wireless mics, tambourines, a disco ball, and some multicolored dance club lights. It'd bring it up to par.  But in light of the fact that New Orleans has very few private karaoke options, this place is great.</p>
