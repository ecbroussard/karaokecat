					<h1>Hi, I'm karaoke cat!</h1>
					<p>Welcome to my review site.</p>
					<p>I love, love, love singing karaoke, but some karaoke venues are way better than others. In my quest to find the perfect karaoke spot, I've spent many disappointing nights munching on tasteless mozzarella sticks while waiting three hours for my turn to sing one measly song. I have endured these sacrifices, so you don't have to.</p>
					<p>I've made it my life's mission to try out every karaoke venue I possibly can, so I can recommend the absolute best ones to you. On this review site, you'll find all the information you need to plan a perfect night out with your friends. No more unbearably smoky bars with creepy, too-eager dudes. No more annoying KJs. No more overpriced drinks. All karaoke and all fun. To see the rating system I use for all reviews, click <a href="rating.html">here.</a> To dive right in to my useful reviews, click <a href="reviews.html">here.</a></p>
					<h1>About Me</h1>
					<p>Besides eating, taking naps, and scratching things, singing karaoke is my absolute favorite activity. I discovered my passion for vocals when one night my inebriated owner accidentally knocked over a bottle of Angry Orchard Hard Cider, and some of it spilled into my water bowl. She then proceeded to crank up some Ace of Base. The next thing I knew, we were both locked in fierce competition over who could sing "Don't Turn Around" the loudest. I won. It was my proudest moment.</p>
					<p>After that night, I decided to quit my day job (of chewing on strings and knocking over glassware), and I became a professional karaoke singer. I have traveled far and wide in search of the best karaoke venue in the universe. This website is the fruit of my labor.</p>
